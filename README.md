# Here I have used content based filtering.
# Content-Based Recommender Systems
 These systems recommend items similar to those a user has shown interest in based on the content. For example, if a user likes action movies, the system will recommend other action movies. This requires creating tags and analyzing the content of items.

# Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems
These systems recommend items based on user interactions and preferences. If two users, User1 and User2, like the same movie, the system assumes their tastes are similar. Thus, the system will recommend movies that User1 likes to User2 and vice versa.

# Hybrid Recommender Systems
These systems combine both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches to provide more accurate recommendations.
